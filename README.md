### Troubleshooting:
- **ASCII art is too zoomed in**
    - Zoom out from the command prompt by holding Ctrl and scrolling mouse wheel down.
    
- **ASCII art is not displaying the picture properly/ASCII art doesn't resemble picture inputed**
    - Minimize command prompt and then unminimize
    
### Features to be added:
- Allow user to choose picture to convert to ASCII art through command prompt instead of editting source code
- Resize picture based on command prompt window and picutre dimensions
