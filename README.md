## Troubleshooting:
- **ASCII art is too zoomed in**
    - Zoom out from the command prompt by holding Ctrl and scrolling mouse wheel down.
    
- **ASCII art is not displaying the picture properly/ASCII art doesn't resemble picture inputted**
    - Minimize command prompt window and then maximize
    
- **Prints out "Error, please try again." in console after choosing a file**
    - The file type of the picture is not supported by Pillow, please only use files found in <a href="http://recordit.co/" target="_blank">**this list.**</a>
    
## Features to be added:
- Resize picture based on command prompt window and picture dimensions
